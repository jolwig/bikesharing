# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to identify key trends for Citibike's bikesharing service. I performed this analysis using Python and Tableau.

## Results

![Checkout times for User](https://github.com/jolwig/bikesharing/blob/main/Checkout%20times%20for%20users.png)
Most rides last 5-10 min. Very few rides last longer than 40 min.

![Checkout times by Gender](https://github.com/jolwig/bikesharing/blob/main/Checkout%20times%20by%20gender.png)
This graph is similar to the previous graph except now the checkout times are broken down by gender. Checkout out times are consistant for all genders except the peak for "Unkown" is more flat and it ranges from 5-30 min.

![Trips by Weekday](https://github.com/jolwig/bikesharing/blob/main/Trips%20by%20weekday.png)
This graph displays the number of trips taken on every day on the week (Dark blue = more trips, light blue = less trips). The busiest times are Monday-Friday at 8am and 5-6pm (Work commute maybe). Saturday and Sunday are fairly busy from 9am-6pm.

![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/jolwig/bikesharing/blob/main/trips%20by%20gender.png)
This graph is supposed to be the same as the previous except broken down by gender. The popular hours are mostly the same for both genders although males have more rides overall.

## Summary
Citi can use this data to determine to better understand their custumers. A graph the displays start stations and end stations for each ride displayed over a map could be interesting. It would be an easy was to visualize the most common routes. A graph that displays the total number of rides for each bike could also be useful. Bikes that have more rides will likely need maintenence more often.
